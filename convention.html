                        <h3>BASEL CONVENTION</h3>
                        <p>THE MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTES HAS BEEN ON THE international environmental agenda from the early 1980s, when it was included as one of three priority areas in the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) first Montevideo Programme on Environmental Law in 1981. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (hereinafter referred to as “the Basel Convention”) was adopted in 1989, in response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad. Awakening environmental awareness and corresponding tightening of environmental regulations in the industrialized world in the 1970s and 1980s had led to increasing public resistance to the disposal of hazardous wastes – in accordance with what became known as the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome – and to an escalation of disposal costs. This in turn led some operators to seek cheap disposal options for hazardous wastes in Eastern Europe and the developing world, where environmental awareness was much less developed and regulations and enforcement mechanisms were lacking. It was against this background that the Basel Convention was negotiated in the late 1980s, and its thrust at the time of its adoption was to combat the “toxic trade”, as it was termed. The Convention entered into force in 1992.

                           <h3>Aims and Provisions of the Basel Convention</h3> 
                            <p>
                                The overarching objective of the Basel Convention is to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics (article 1 and annexes I, III, VIII and IX), as well as two types of wastes defined as “other wastes” (household waste and incinerator ash; article 1 and annex II). The provisions of the Convention center around the following principal aims: (i) the reduction of hazardous waste generation and the promotion of environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, wherever the place of disposal; (ii) the restriction of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes except where it is perceived to be in accordance with the principles of environmentally sound management; and (iii) a regulatory system applying to cases where transboundary movements are permissible. The first aim is addressed through a number of general provisions requiring States to observe the fundamental principles of environmentally sound waste management (article 4). A number of prohibitions are designed to attain the second aim: hazardous wastes may not be exported to Antarctica, to a State not party to the Basel Convention, or to a party having banned the import of hazardous wastes (article 4). Parties may, however, enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements on hazardous waste management with other parties or with non-parties, provided that such agreements are “no less environmentally sound” than the Basel Convention (article 11). In all cases where transboundary movement is not, in principle, prohibited, it may take place only if it represents an environmentally sound solution, if the principles of environmentally sound management and non-discrimination are observed and if it is carried out in accordance with the Convention’s regulatory system. The regulatory system is the cornerstone of the Basel Convention as originally adopted. Based on the concept of prior informed consent, it requires that, before an export may take place, the authorities of the State of export notify the authorities of the prospective States of import and transit, providing them with detailed information on the intended movement. The movement may only proceed if and when all States concerned have given their written consent (articles 6 and 7). The Basel Convention also provides for cooperation between parties, ranging from exchange of information on issues relevant to the implementation of the Convention to technical assistance, particularly to developing countries (articles 10 and 13). The Secretariat is required to facilitate and support this cooperation, acting as a clearing-house (article 16). In the event of a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes having been carried out illegally, i.e. in contravention of the provisions of articles 6 and 7, or cannot be completed as foreseen, the Convention attributes responsibility to one or more of the States involved, and imposes the duty to ensure safe disposal, either by re-import into the State of generation or otherwise (articles 8 and 9). Similar to most modern multilateral environmental agreements, the Basel Convention features its own institutional framework. The COP is the supreme decisionmaking body of the Convention. The Basel Convention Secretariat, provided by UNEP, prepares, organizes and services meetings under the Convention, facilitates exchange of information and provides guidance and assistance to parties on legal and technical issues. The Secretariat also has a limited mandate to facilitate implementation of the Convention by parties. The Subsidiary Bodies of the Conference of the Parties are the Expanded Bureau, the Open-ended Working Group and the Implementation and Compliance Committee.
                                The Convention also provides for the establishment of regional or sub-regional centres for training and technology transfers regarding the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes and the minimization of their generation to cater to the specific needs of different regions and subregions (article 14). Fourteen such centres have been established. They carry out training and capacity building activities in the regions.

                            <p>
                                The Bamako Convention is a treaty of African nations prohibiting the import into Africa of any hazardous (including radioactive) waste. The convention came into force in 1998.

                            </p>
                            <h4>Origin</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Bamako convention is a response to Article 11 of the Basel convention which encourages parties to enter into bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements on Hazardous Waste to help achieve the objectives of the convention. The impetus for the Bamako convention arose also from:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The failure of the Basel Convention to prohibit trade of hazardous waste to less developed countries (LDCs):</li>
                                <li>The realization that many developed nations were exporting toxic wastes to Africa (Koko case in Nigeria, Probo Koala case in Ivory Coast).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Specificity</h4>
                            <p>The Bamako convention uses a format and language similar to that of the Basel convention, except that: (a) it is much stronger in prohibiting all imports of hazardous waste, and (b) it does not make exceptions on certain hazardous wastes (like those for radioactive materials) made by the Basel convention.</p>
                            <h4>Status of the Convention</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>It was negotiated by 12 nations of the African Union (former Organization of African Unity) at Bamako, Mali in January, 1991.</li>
                                <li>It came into force in 1998.</li>
                                <li>To date, it has 29 Signatories and 25 Parties</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Purpose of the Convention</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To prohibit the import of all hazardous and radioactive wastes into the African continent for any reason</li>
                                <li>To minimize and control transboundary movements of hazardous wastes within the African continent.</li>
                                <li>To prohibit all ocean and inland water dumping or incineration of hazardous wastes.</li>
                                <li>To ensure that disposal of wastes is conducted in an “environmentally sound manner".</li>
                                <li> To promote cleaner production over the pursuit of a permissible emissions approach based on assimilative capacity assumptions</li>
                                <li>To establish the precautionary principle.</li>

                        <h3>STOCKHOLM CONVENTION</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 2001 is a international agreement by the nations of the world to address the global chemical pollution. Its objective is to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants or POPs. POPs include the organochlorine pesticides DDT, endrin, dieldrin, aldrin, chlordane, toxaphene, heptachlor, mirex, and hexachlorobenzene, as well as the industrial chemicals and by-products PCBs, dioxins, and furans. These initial twelve chemicals, the 'poisons without passports' were chosen because they have the common hazardous characteristics of toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation, and are capable of travelling vast distances via water and air.
                            The Convention aims to eliminate the production, use and emissions of POPs while preventing the introduction of new chemicals with POP-like characteristics and ensuring the environmentally sound destruction of POPs waste stockpiles. The Convention sets out the actions that country Parties must take to achieve this. It also requires country Parties to reduce and where feasible, eliminate releases of byproduct POPs chemicals.
                            Technical and financial assistance is offered to developing country Parties to help implement the Stockholm Convention.

                            <H4>persistent organic pollutant review committee </H4>
                            <P>
                                When adopting the Convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 2–6 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the Convention.
                                The Committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the Convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland since its establishment.
